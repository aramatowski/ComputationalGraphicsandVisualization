# **How do I approach designing software?**
# I learned how to use OpenGL to render 3D objects, adjust their color, shape, and size while working on this project. My design process consisted of using graphs to draw and plan the coordinates of each side of the shapes, then rendering the shapes first, applying texture, and then applying lighting. I will use the graph approach in future projects, as it helped me visualize the shapes and calculate their coordinates on the window.

# **How do I approach developing programs?**
# I learned more about coding errors and how to read through error messages during this project. This is because I came across many errors during this project and got a lot of practice with the error messages. I used an iterative approach for this project. Each week, I created a functioning project with added features from the previous week. My development process has evolved greatly while working on this project. Up until this point, I really had not used an iterative approach because previous courses did not require submissions of functioning code from the project for every week of the course.

# **How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
# I am studying computer science with plans to become a software engineer. This course has given me practice to utilize skills that will be required in upcoming courses and in future careers. This is the first time I have created 3D objects and animations and I plan to continue gaining more knowledge with these new skills to create more realistic-looking objects for future projects.
